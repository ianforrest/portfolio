What is a headless CMS? Why would a company use one? To answer that, let's break down how websites are traditionally built to see the benefit of lopping off a website's head.

When you build a website, you choose a content management system (CMS) so that it’s easy for your people to update the website in the future: change text, add photos and add new pages. Most websites today are built with traditional CMSes, where the code for your CMS is tightly integrated into the actual website and web pages delivered to your website visitors, i.e. the presentation layer. This presentation layer of your website (where the actual design is determined) and the content layer (where the content is authored and created) are all baked into the same pie.

In some cases, that makes for a good solution. If you want to publish a website for a straightforward small business to list open hours, a shop address and contact information, you probably want a simple option, like SquareSpace, Wix, Shopify or WordPress.

But what happens if you use a *headless* CMS? Well, you’ve fully separated the presentation of your website from the content authoring part of your website. 

Consider cat monster.

Cat monster with a traditional CMS is all part of the same entity. Once cat monster’s head is removed from their body, however, they gain flexibility to have as many heads as they want. Cat monster can now use the data from their body (a single headless CMS) as the content for any product they want: an iPhone app, an Android app, a smart TV app, a product marketing website and a company intranet.

That starts to look pretty attractive for a company that wants to futureproof the content they invest in creating. The best way to build a website always starts with an “it depends,” but there is absolutely a right choice and a wrong choice for companies with complexities and varied consumption points for the data produced by their CMS. I’d run, and not walk, to a headless CMS if that sounds like your organization.

Some common headless CMSes: [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/), [Strapi](https://strapi.io/), [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/), and even [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) and [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) *can* be headless CMSes, too.

CMSes aren’t the only thing going headless, either. You may hear the term “headless” in other contexts around web and software development, too. For instance, headless commerce for ecommerce companies. Or if a developer wants to test software, they might use a “headless” version of the Chrome web browser, meaning they can test their product sans the visual browser interface.
